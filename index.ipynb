The development of integrative workflows using the mainstream Software as a service (SaaS) distribution model is usually not feasible for academic labs, small teams, students, and drug discovery enthusiasts. To advance integrative drug discovery, we developed a set of open-source lightweight modular analysis workflows. These workflows describe the early stages of biological assay development and high throughput screening and provide a hands-on introduction to Drug Discovery for everybody with basic knowledge of biology, python programming, or data science. </div>"
